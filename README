-----SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS-----

The Dielectric2 plugin requires:

 - HOOMD v2.3.5, compiled with CUDA
 - CUDA-9.2
 - CUSP-0.5.1
 - Python 3.6.5

The HOOMD installation must have GPU acceleration enabled, and HOOMD must be compiled as a shared library for
plugins to be built against it.  The build has been tested with CUDA-9.2 and Python 3.6.5 but newer/older
versions may still work. Older versions of CUSP are likely not to work because of incompatibilies with the thrust
version included with CUDA. 

-----COMPILING THE PLUGIN-----

To compile this plugin, follow steps similar to those in compiling HOOMD-Blue.  Note that plugins can only be built
against a hoomd build that has been installed via a package or compiled and then installed via 'make install'.
Plugins can only be built against hoomd when it is built as a shared library.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make -j6
$ make install

By default, make install will install the plugin into
/{hoomd-install}/hoomd/Dielectric2
where {hoomd-install} is the directory that hoomd was 'make install'ed into.
The plugin can be imported into python as a module with
import hoomd.Dieletric2
